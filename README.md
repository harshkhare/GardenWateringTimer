Garden watering timer using Arduino Uno

This simple timer circuit using Arduino Uno lets you set two timers, one for total watering cycle and another for the duration for which you want to keep water running in each cycle. For example, you might want to turn on the water every 12 hours (cycle) for 2 minutes (duration).

I have kept the circuit diagram in the repository for quick reference but more details can be found on my website- https://harshavardhankhare.wordpress.com/garden-watering-timer-using-arduino-uno/
